## Abstract
Quantifying patient health by predicting the mortality is an important problem in critical care research. An accurate prediction of patient mortality can help with the assessment of severity of illness and guide decision making in terms of drastic measures required to save a patient. In this paper, we propose a simple Graph Neural Network based architecture for mortality prediction of patients in the ICU and compare it to a Recurrent Neural Network based benchmark model (GRU). GNNs are known to help extract information from data that can be inherently represented as a graph and this contributes to the explain-ability of the deep learning model which is becoming increasingly essential to all clinical prediction tasks. We find that, given enough time, GNNs perform equivalent to RNNs. We also find that in general, deep learning models perform better when raw features are used. 

## Data
We used the [MIMIC  III](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/overview/), a  publicly available  critical  caredatabase  maintained  by  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  (MIT)â€™s  Laboratoryfor  Computational  Physiology. It  integrates  de-identified,  comprehensive  clinical  data  ofpatients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at the Beth Israel Deaconess MedicalCenter (BIDMC) in Boston, Massachusetts during 2001 to 2012.  MIMIC-III contains dataassociated with 53,423 distinct hospital admissions for adult patients whose age is above 15and 7,870 admissions for neonates.  For easy benchmarking, we only included the recordsof the first ICU admission of the adult patients (36,093).  We built the relational databasemimicwith 26 raw tables using PostgreSQL (The instructions can be found [here](https://mimic.physionet.org/tutorials/install-mimic-locally-windows/)). You should request access before using MIMIC III datasets.
